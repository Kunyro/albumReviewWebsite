                <strong>Peak Instrumental Hip-hop</strong>
                <br>

                Masterpiece of assembled sound. When I listen to this album I think about how 
                the drums are so central to it, and most of the songs are defined by how the 
                drums sound and what they're doing, that "student of the drums..." clip being 
                one of the first things you hear is very intentional. I've been coming back to 
                it for a good decade now and I've gotten new things from it as time goes on so 
                it's really a lasting personal favorite. I love how Midnight In A Perfect World 
                has a vocal sample that isn't revealed to be super corny until the very end. 
                The stretch of Changeling - Transmission 1 - What Does Your Soul Look Like Pt 4 
                is certainly one of my favorite 13 minutes in music. When the saxophone comes 
                in on Soul Pt 4... I float off to a different planet when that saxophone comes 
                in. That is probably my favorite beat ever and a truly sublime piece of music. 
                If there's an album for max volume in the car driving through downtown at 4am 
                it's this and Burial. Everybody knows that! The fast drum part in Stem/Long 
                Stem has never really done anything for me though but beyond that it's god 
                level heady music. It's pretty incredible that this album has the status it 
                does because this guy with like two singles out puts together a bunch of 
                samples off records he found in the basement of a single record store in 
                Sacramento and here it's rated higher than Blood on the Tracks and Rubber Soul 
                and In A Silent Way. But I get it, there's a remarkable depth that is 
                otherworldly and very addictive. When I think about what his music sounds like 
                now and how he never made anything close to this level again, it makes me think 
                there was some sort of divine energy that was channeled through him to make 
                these specific samples be found and put in this arrangement with each other, 
                like it was meant to happen and he was merely the vessel for it. A marvelous 
                and singular piece of music that exists in its own world.

                e: what else sounds like this? This is an eternal album. It will always sound 
                like it's from the future. The fact that the source records were all from the 
                same record store's basement and fit together like puzzle pieces makes me think 
                this was meant to happen, I will be playing this on the nice headphones at 3am 
                when I'm 90
