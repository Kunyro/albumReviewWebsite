                <strong>This feels like the Finnegan's Wake of Hip Hop</strong>
                <br>
                <br>
                It's been a very very long time since an album hit me quite like 
                To Pimp a Butterfly has been hitting me daily for the last couple months. 
                I remember first hearing this thinking it was nothing special at all, and now 
                I'm here thinking just how deaf and dumb I must've been. The difference between 
                this and other albums of its kind—the kind that leaves me winded at the end of 
                it—is that it's not only that the musical value of the album is unparalleled, 
                but there is a clear, palpable importance that carries the album deeper. 
                This is what a modern classic looks like. This is the greatest album the last 
                30 years has given.

                Like honestly, there are multiple times where this album shakes my foundation. 
                The hollow echo that resonates through each retold exchange of 
                "How Much a Dollar Cost" is earthshattering. The final verse of "These Walls" 
                which lays down the whole reality of the situation, framing the first four 
                introspective minutes into an actual context? I cried at that one and still do. 
                There's so many moments where Kendrick took enormous risk and attained exactly 
                the goals he wanted from them. That second verse of "u"? That's insane how he 
                completely mixes up his vocal style, his writing style, his flow, and his 
                diction all at one time for exactly one time in order to hit the most personal, 
                deep core of his Self. I can't think of any other time a rapper bared his soul 
                like that and still had it fit so well within both the album itself and the 
                genealogy of hip hop. Splicing himself into an interview with Tupac, and having 
                Pac interact metaphysically with his own work? Structuring an album around a 
                single poem, having the entire narrative hinge on a single thought—leaving that 
                thought unanswered by Pac? The muddled Butterfly concept along with the subtle 
                personification of American capitalism, the music industry, the rap game, his 
                own conscious, and his own sense of pride? It took me a long time to really 
                pick up on all of that, but now the album unfolds more and more with each line 
                and everything feels intimate and endlessly conscious. I'm honestly not sure 
                if any album has reached the level of this one.
