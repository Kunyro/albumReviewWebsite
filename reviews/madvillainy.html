                <strong>Madvillainy is most definitely one of the best Hip Hop albums ever made.</strong>
                <br>
                <br>
                MF Doom and Madlib came together to create something truly special and they both 
                complimented each other absolutely brilliantly. It really was the perfect 
                collaboration and remains one of the best hip-hop collaborations ever. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Madlib's production is absolutely flawless. Hip-hop albums need to be perfectly 
                produced if they're going to have a real impact and a long lasting effect. 
                Any truly great hip-hop album's strength lies in its production - Illmatic, 36 
                Chambers and My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy are my favourite hip-hop albums 
                and I think that they're all perfectly produced and I'd most definitely add 
                Madvillany into that exclusive club. It really is a masterclass of hip-hop 
                production and it's all down to Madlib. His unpredictable, inventive, innovative 
                beats combined with Doom's brilliant rapping, flow, delivery and lyrical abilities 
                is absolutely fantastic. Madlib lays down the canvas and paints a wonderful picture, 
                but he still leaves space for Doom to express himself and put his own distinctive 
                mark on the painting.

                Madvillainy is perfectly produced, the beats are incredibly inventive, 
                unpredictable and unique. They're abstract and jazzy which are my favourite 
                kind of beats. The rapping and flow is incredibly lazy and sloppy which I adore, 
                the sampling is absolutely genius and the lyrics are amazing. It contains some of 
                my favourite lyrics to be put on a hip-hop album. It has lyrical depth that a lot 
                of albums don't seem to have. The wordplay is great, they're quirky, fun, 
                interesting and thought provoking. I'm not sure what my favourite thing about it 
                is. The beats, the lyrics or the sampling. I can't choose between them, but I must 
                say that the sampling is absolutely mindblowing. The use of samples is amazing. 
                The things they chose to sample and the way they were executed and incorporated 
                into the songs were incredible. An absolutely fantastic album, that's near perfect.
